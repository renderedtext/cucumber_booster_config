Boosters help you with distribution of your test files across many parallel jobs and optimize your build time. Find out more about [Boosters](https://semaphoreci.com/docs/about-boosters.html).

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "semaphore_cucumber_booster_config"
```

```
$ cucumber-booster-config help inject

  cucumber-booster-config inject PATH

  Options:
    [--dry-run], [--no-dry-run]

```

If you use the `--dry-run` option, output will look like this:

```

## Usage from other scripts

You can invoke the injector script programaticaly too:

``` ruby
current_path = Dir.pwd

```

This is how Test Boosters gem is using it to configure Cucumber.
